Here's how to fix pick all tools:

1. Spawn a random item at a random position in the server
2. Remove the E to interact option on the item, so that picking it up requires the remote to be fired manually
  - Of course anyone can detect if it's removed, I'll leave that fix up to you
3. Wait a random time
4. Repeat
